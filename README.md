# tjStuff+

Welcome to my GitHub Repository containing all my code for the pitching model I created, called tjStuff+. The goal of tjStuff+ was to create a model which predicts the Expected Run Value of a pitch based off its physical characteristics.

This Repo contains all code used to create the model. I have also written an article covering my metholodoy and created a Streamlit App which tabulates and illustrates the metric for MLB Pitchers during the 2024 Season.

### Medium Article

Please refer to my Medium Article which covers more information about tjStuff+.

### Streamlit App

Please check ouy my [Streamlit App](https://tjstatsapps-tjstuffplus.hf.space/) which tabulates and plots tjStuff+ for all MLB players during the 2024 MLB Season.
